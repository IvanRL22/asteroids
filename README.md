# Asteroids
Second boot.dev project!  
Basic project was coded in an afternoon on 23/03/2025

## Running the game
If you're on a Windows (like me, PC master race rise up), you'll have followed the same instructions as I did to install WSL console  
Just remember to run this command everytime you open the console:

``` shell

source venv/bin/activate
```

## Improvements
There's a list of suggested improvements at the end of the project  
I would like to eventually add them to experiment more with python and pygame  
Here's the list:

- Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
